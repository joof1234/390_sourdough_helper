    /*
    Each day record the min and max co2, humidity, temperature and height. after 16 hours each day you compare the max and the minimum
    and you put a section for each element.

    conditions to tell the user to go on the next feeding/day:
    (actually making dough)
    Check if there was a 3- 4 times increase in co2
    If dough doubles in height good sign your starter is going well

    if the user doesnt meet these in 24 hours (in 1 day) then there is an issue.
    You give trouble shooting tips, maybe tell them to restart, add water, flour, etc.

    Conditions to warn the user (notifications)
    IF the temperature is under 24 C then you need to tell them that your starter is
    not growing optimally.
    If the temperature is over 28, it is growing too fast and the quality is going to be bad
    If the humidity is under 70% (confirm), you tell the user that it is too dry, add water
    If the humidity is over 90% too wet. You messed up. You need to restart.
    The user will get these as notifications, so when something like this happens, we send a notification
    to tell them that something is wrong.

    ERROR HANDLING:
    -portrait mode issue. When you decide to rotate your phone, your app will rotate and mess up the entire UI.
    Make sure you can lock the entire app to just portrait mode to avoid this issue.
    Search up ways to make an app unbreakable.
    - Maybe you should try to break it using what people said.
    - For example, if you press many buttons at the same time, does it crash?
    - If you spam things really really fast, will it crash? How can we fix this?
    - Literally try it on your app, spam press things rally fast and it might just crash/
